🚀 End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This project showcases a production-grade data pipeline built using
Google Cloud Storage, PySpark on Dataproc, BigQuery, Apache Airflow, and Looker Studio.

The pipeline ingests raw NYC Yellow Taxi data → transforms it using distributed PySpark → loads it into BigQuery → visualizes insights → and finally supports real-time streaming via Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming.

⚡ TL;DR — What I Built

✔ Batch ingestion → GCS
✔ Distributed processing → Dataproc (PySpark)
✔ Data warehouse → BigQuery
✔ Visualization → Looker Studio
✔ Orchestration → Airflow DAG
✔ Real-time streaming → Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming
✔ Processed 2.7M+ records with optimized transformations

🏗️ Full Architecture (Batch Pipeline)
Raw CSV → Google Cloud Storage (Raw Zone)
        → Dataproc PySpark Job (Transform & Clean)
        → Google Cloud Storage (Processed Zone)
        → BigQuery Partitioned Tables (Analytics Warehouse)
        → Looker Studio Reports & Dashboards

🎯 How to Run the Project (Quick Start)
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Upload Raw CSV to GCS
gsutil cp nyc_taxi_raw.csv gs://ruthvik-week3-bucket-2/raw/

3️⃣ Run Week 2 Cleanup
python week2/clean_data.py

4️⃣ Submit PySpark Job on Dataproc
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark \
    --cluster=my-spark-cluster \
    --region=us-central1 \
    week3/process_big_data.py

5️⃣ Airflow DAG Loads Processed CSV → BigQuery Automatically
6️⃣ Open Looker Dashboard (Live Link)

🌬️ Week 5 – Real-Time Streaming (Kafka + Spark Structured Streaming)

This week adds near real-time micro-batch processing.

🔥 Architecture
Producer → Kafka Topic (`taxi_trips`) 
        → Spark Structured Streaming (JSON processing)
        → GCS / Local JSON Output

✔ Technologies Used

Kafka 3.5.1, Zookeeper, Spark 3.5.1, JSON events, WSL2 Ubuntu.

✔ Real Output Sample
{"VendorID":1,"trip_distance":3.5,"fare_amount":12.5,...}

✔ What I Learned

Kafka topic creation

Producer/Consumer basics

Micro-batch streaming

Checkpointing & fault tolerance

Fixing Spark classpath issues

🌀 Orchestration — Airflow DAG

This DAG automatically:

Lists all processed CSV files in GCS

Loads them into BigQuery

Truncates table and refreshes analytics daily

📌 DAG Code Used
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.gcs import GCSListObjectsOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_bigquery import GCSToBigQueryOperator


with DAG(
    dag_id="gcs_to_bigquery_dag",
    start_date=datetime(2025, 11, 8),
    schedule="0 0 * * *",   # Runs once per day
    catchup=False,
    tags=["gcs", "bigquery"],
):
    
    list_gcs_files = GCSListObjectsOperator(
        task_id="list_gcs_files",
        bucket="ruthvik-week3-bucket-2",
        prefix="",
        gcp_conn_id="google_cloud_default"
    )

    load_to_bigquery = GCSToBigQueryOperator(
        task_id="load_to_bigquery",
        bucket="ruthvik-week3-bucket-2",
        source_objects=["week3/output/part-*.csv"],
        destination_project_dataset_table="ruthvik-week3-dataproc.nyc_taxi_demo.trips",
        write_disposition="WRITE_TRUNCATE",
        source_format="CSV",
        skip_leading_rows=1,
        autodetect=True,
        gcp_conn_id="google_cloud_default",
    )

    list_gcs_files >> load_to_bigquery

Successful DAG run

📈 Key Insights from the Data

2.8M+ rides analyzed

Avg fare stays stable for 1–4 passengers, spikes at 7+

Trip volume spikes ≠ fare spikes

Pickup hotspots: Manhattan transit, tourist zones

Seasonal patterns in trip count & revenue

🎯 Next Steps (Planned Enhancements)

Stream Kafka data directly into BigQuery

Add Kafka Connect + Schema Registry

Add Terraform (IaC for bucket, cluster, BQ)

Add CI/CD using Cloud Build or GitHub Actions

Build a monitoring dashboard (Cloud Logging + Grafana)
